Metadata File Structure

Repository description:

R scripts and data for Maromizaha seed dispersal project, which assesses how mature and regenerating 
rainforests differ in their primate disperser communities, seed rain, and adult plant reproduction at 
Maromizaha Natural Resources Reserve, eastern Madagascar.

File list & descriptions:

dispersal.seed.individuals.csv: Data on species and size of seeds collected from seed traps 
classified as dispersed.

lemur_abundances.csv: Data on lemur encounters by species for each transect survey. 
Encounter rates measured in individuals/meter.

lemur_functional_encounter_rates.csv: Data on lemur encounters by functional groups 
(body size, diet, activiy period) for each transect survey. Encounter rates measured 
in individuals/meter.

lemur_size_combined.csv: Data on lemur encounters by body size.

lemur_survey_species_encounter_rates.csv: Data on lemur encounters by species for each transect survey.

lemur_transect_rates2.csv: Data on cumulative lemur encounters by functional group. 
Encounter rates measured in individuals/meter. Formatted for visualization.

overhang_phenology.csv: Data on fruiting and flowering of adult plants overhanging seed traps by survey week.

plant_community_overhang.csv: Data on species identity and abundance in adult plants overhanging seed traps 
by trap cluster.

rain.seed.individuals.csv: Data on species and size of seeds collected from seed traps (all samples).

seed.rain.dispersal.rates.csv: Data on rates of seed rain and dispersal from seed trap samples per survey week 
along each transect.

seed_dispersal_counts.csv: Data on cumulative counts of dispersed seeds in seed traps for each transect by species.

seed_rain_counts.csv: Data on cumulative counts of total seeds in seed traps for each transect by species.
