Repository description:

R scripts and data for Maromizaha seed dispersal project, which assesses how mature and regenerating 
rainforests differ in their primate disperser communities, seed rain, and adult plant reproduction at 
Maromizaha Natural Resources Reserve, eastern Madagascar.

Encounter rates measured in individuals/meter.

lemur_functional_encounter_rates.csv: Data on lemur encounters by functional groups 
(body size, diet, activiy period) for each transect survey. Encounter rates measured 
in individuals/meter.

lemur_size_combined.csv: 

lemur_survey_species_encounter_rates.csv: Data on lemur encounters by species for each transect survey.

lemur_transect_rates2.csv: Data on cumulative lemur encounters by functional group.
